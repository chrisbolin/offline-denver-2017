# THE REST


WHEN THINGS GO WELL

[Screenshot of Google Analytics] I am not popular on the internet
Are you ready if things go well?
CDNs, servers, HTTPS, international CDNs

TROLLS

some people are just mean [Screenshot of reddit]
people will try to break it, and anything else they find [skycoins screenshot]
some people can be won over (if thatâ€™s what your in to)
donâ€™t be afraid to just mute something
r/programming and hacker news can both be a little rough
twitter, facebook, (and even linkedin) are a little friendlier

OPEN SOURCE

sign of good faith
open sourced the demo and the logic
simple at first, develops more complexity as bugs are discovered and troubleshoot

TRANSLATION

- people might want to translate your site (especially if it's open source).
    - you'll need to decide what path to take
Translation is hard
non-professional translators
people don't proofread. youâ€™ll always have people reach out.
beware of autocorrect
Google Translate is awesome
right to left is a nightmare (e.g. trying to select text)

TAKEAWAYS

make the shit you want to make.
most times people wonâ€™t notice.
share it if you want
- Why the web is awesome
the web is a place for experimentation
it's much much easier to get someone to visit a website than download an app
